This contract was built as an experimental deflationary staking token on the ETH network.

There is a 6% transfer fee on each transfer. 3% is burned and the other 3% rewarded to SHOCK holders proportionate to their SHOCK holdings.

Users are able to claim their rewards from the smart contract by selecting the payout rewards function.

They are also able to view their current unpaid rewards from the contract.

The fullUnitsStaked_total is the total supply minus the creator, contract and excluded from staking addresses.

Example

SHOCK holder 1 holds 1000

fullUnitsstaked_total = 10000

Then Holder 1 is eliglable for 10% of the 3% SHOCK sent to the contract from that transaction.

So if 1000 SHOCK are transferred, 60 SHOCK are taken as a fee. 30 SHOCK to the burn address and 30 SHOCK to the contract for holders.

Holder 1 is now eligible to claim 10% of the 30 SHOCK sent to the contract in that transaction.
